## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Convoy not spawning**: Check prefab path in configuration
2. **Dome not creating**: Ensure ZoneManager is installed and loaded
3. **UI not showing**: Verify player has `convoydomedpvp.use` permission
4. **Economy not working**: Check Economics plugin integration
5. **NPCs not spawning**: Verify NPC prefab paths are correct

### Debug Commands
Use F1 console for debugging:
```
oxide.grant user <steamid> convoydomedpvp.admin
convoy.start
convoy.stop
```
